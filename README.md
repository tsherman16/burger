# *Eat-Da-Burger*

# What the application does

This application is a burger logger, allowing the user to populate a burger of there choice in a list displayed on the lft of the screen. Once the user chooses a burger to eat it will then move to the left showing the burger has been devoured.


# How to run the application

To run the application, the user just needs to get to the homepage that shows a text box for the user to enter the burger they would with to add to the list of burgers available. Once the user has entered the burger, they need to hit the green button labeled "Add Burger". This will then display the burger the user has entered on the left side of the screen along with two buttons: Devour and Delete. If the user chooses to devour the burger the burger then is displayed on the left side of the screen along with the other burgers that have been devoured. Once that occurs, the burger has two buttons to the right of it as well: Replace and Delete. The replace button will just move the burger from devoured back to the list of burgers for the user to then devour again if they would like. The delete button in both sections removes the burger from the list all together.
